# Introduction

Dive into the data job market! Focusing on data analyst roles, this project explores:
* Top-paying jobs
* In-demand skills
* Optimal skills: where high demand meets high salary in data analytics.

# Background

This project was born out of a personal need to navigate the data engineering landscape more strategically. With an overwhelming number of tools, platforms, and skills out there, I set out to answer a focused question:

> Which skills should a data engineer prioritize to land high-paying, remote-friendly roles?

The dataset comes courtesy of [Luke Barousse's SQL course,](https://lukebarousse.com/sql) which provided both the data and inspiration for this exploration.

# Key Questions

1. What are the top-paying data engineering jobs?
2. Which skills are most commonly required in the highest-paying data engineering jobs?
3. Which skills are most in demand in these roles?
4. Which skills offer the best ROI — high salary and high demand?

# Key Learnings
- The job market rewards engineers who combine cloud platforms (AWS, Azure) with modern data tools like Databricks, Kafka, and Spark.

- Some lesser-known skills (e.g., Rust, Neo4j) command surprisingly high salaries in remote roles — showing a market for niche expertise.

- SQL and Python remain non-negotiable foundations, appearing across nearly all top roles.

# Recommendations
- Focus on high-leverage skills: those with both high demand and high salary (e.g., Spark, Kafka, Snowflake).

- Consider learning niche but lucrative tools like Rust or GraphQL if you're aiming for remote or specialized roles.

- Keep fundamentals (SQL, Python) sharp, but build around them with cloud and orchestration tools (Airflow, Databricks, Kubernetes).

# Conclusion
This project provided a structured look into the world of data engineering careers. With SQL and upcoming visualizations, we answered key questions about pay, demand, and skill optimization — helping both new and seasoned engineers make data-informed career moves.
