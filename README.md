## Data Careers Insight Project — Skills vs. Salary in Data Engineering
This project is a strategic deep dive into the data job market, with a special focus on data engineering and analytics roles. Using SQL, Python, and visualizations, it answers the question:

> Which skills should data professionals prioritize to land high-paying, remote-friendly jobs?

It leverages a job listing dataset thanks to [Luke Barousse’s SQL course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql) and turns raw data into actionable insights around skills, demand, and compensation.

## Project Objectives
This project explores:
- Top-paying jobs in data engineering
- In-demand skills for those jobs
- Optimal skills that offer both high demand and high salaries
- Data-driven recommendations for aspiring or advancing data professionals

## Key Learnings
- The job market rewards engineers who combine cloud platforms (AWS, Azure) with modern data tools like Databricks, Kafka, and Spark.

- Some lesser-known skills Rust, Neo4j command surprisingly high salaries in remote roles — showing a market for niche expertise.

- SQL and Python remain non-negotiable foundations, appearing across nearly all top roles.
---
## Recommendations
- Focus on high-ROI tools: Spark, Kafka, Snowflake, Airflow
- Remote-ready stack: Cloud platforms + orchestration tools (e.g., Airflow, Kubernetes)
- Explore niche tools: Rust, GraphQL, Neo4j — especially for specialization
- Keep fundamentals sharp: SQL, Python, Git
---
## Conclusion
This project brings clarity to career decisions in data engineering. By analyzing job listings with SQL and Python, it provides insights into what skills actually matter — from both a salary and demand perspective.

> Whether you’re just starting out or planning your next move, this data-backed guide helps you upskill strategically, not randomly.
